1. Background (Where We Stand)
The company has steady orders and a good market position.
However, profits have reduced over the last year.
From discussions with all teams, it is clear that:
•	Costs are slowly increasing
•	Delays and rework are happening more often
•	Wastage is not clearly visible
•	Inventory is sometimes more than needed
These issues are spread across departments and are not seen together.

2. The Core Business Problem
Today, we do not clearly see:
•	Where exactly money is getting wasted
•	Which products or processes reduce profits
•	Why the same issues repeat every month
Problems are fixed daily, but root causes are not visible, so they return.

3. What We Want to Achieve
The aim is to:
•	Clearly see costs, wastage, delays, and profit
•	Know which products or processes need attention
