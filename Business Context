## Business Problem Statement

The textile manufacturing company has been experiencing operational inefficiencies despite stable demand and established production capabilities.

Senior management observed that production targets were frequently not being met, quality-related losses were increasing, and dispatch commitments were often delayed. 
At the same time, inventory levels appeared higher than expected, leading to concerns around working capital utilization.

While multiple operational reports existed, management lacked a consolidated and reliable view that could clearly explain:
- Where performance gaps were occurring
- Why these gaps were happening
- Which issues required immediate attention

The absence of clearly defined, decision-oriented KPIs made it difficult for management to identify root causes and prioritize corrective actions.

This engagement was initiated to analyze operational data, validate performance metrics, and provide management with actionable insights to improve efficiency, reduce losses, 
and support informed decision-making.
