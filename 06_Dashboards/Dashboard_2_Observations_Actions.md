## Dashboard 2 – Observations & Recommended Actions

### Purpose
This dashboard translates performance data into actionable insights.  
It is designed to support management discussions by clearly connecting observations with root causes and corrective actions.

---

### Structure of the Dashboard
The dashboard is organized into three sections:
1. Key Observations
2. Supporting Evidence
3. Recommended Actions and Expected Impact

---

### Key Observations
- Actual production consistently trails planned production
- Rework and wastage are concentrated in specific processes
- Dispatch delays are systemic rather than occasional
- Inventory holding behavior requires closer monitoring
- A small number of machines contribute disproportionately to downtime

---

### Supporting Evidence
Each observation is supported by:
- Time-based trends
- Process-level breakdowns
- Machine-level downtime analysis

This ensures that observations are data-backed rather than opinion-based.

---

### Recommended Actions
- Align production plans with realistic machine capacity
- Introduce tighter quality controls in high-rework processes
- Address dispatch delays through process and planning improvements
- Monitor inventory at daily granularity to control working capital
- Prioritize preventive maintenance for high-downtime machines

---

### Expected Business Impact
- Reduction in rework and wastage
- Improved production reliability
- Better dispatch performance
- Optimized inventory holding days
- Reduced unplanned downtime

---

### Business Value
This dashboard helps management move from:
- “What is happening?”  
to  
- “Why is it happening and what should we do about it?”

It represents the transition from reporting to decision support.
