## Key Insights

The analysis highlighted several operational patterns that were not clearly visible through existing reports.

---

### Production Performance
Actual production consistently fell short of planned targets, indicating a mismatch between planning assumptions and actual capacity.

---

### Quality Losses
Rework and wastage were concentrated in specific processes, particularly during Dyeing and Finishing, suggesting process-level quality control gaps.

---

### Dispatch Performance
Dispatch delays were systemic rather than isolated incidents, pointing to planning and execution challenges rather than occasional disruptions.

---

### Inventory Behavior
Inventory holding days, when calculated correctly at daily granularity, showed periods of improvement as well as risk of working capital lock-in during specific months.

---

### Maintenance Impact
A small number of machines contributed disproportionately to overall downtime, indicating the need for focused preventive maintenance rather than broad-based interventions.
